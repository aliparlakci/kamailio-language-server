Diagnostics for Writing to Read-Only PVs
=========================================

Some PVs like $rU, $ru, $rm, $ci are read-only in Kamailio. If a user
calls KSR.pv.sets("$rU", ...) the extension should warn them.

The builtinPvs.ts data already has an isReadOnly field. The analyzer
just needs to check it on write operations.

Examples that should warn:
  KSR.pv.sets("$ci", "something")   -> $ci (Call-ID) is read-only
  KSR.pv.seti("$rm", 1)             -> $rm (Request Method) is read-only
  KSR.pv.sets("$rU", "newuser")     -> $rU is read-only

Examples that are fine:
  KSR.pv.sets("$rd", "10.0.0.1")    -> $rd (destination domain) is writable
  KSR.pv.sets("$var(x)", "val")     -> user variables are always writable
  KSR.pv.sets("$td", "outbound")    -> $td is writable

Evidence from usage:
  KSR.pv.sets("$rd", ...) appears multiple times (correct - rd is writable)
  KSR.pv.sets("$td", ...) appears (correct - td is writable)
  No writes to $rU/$ci/$rm found (team already knows the rules, but
  the extension should catch mistakes)
