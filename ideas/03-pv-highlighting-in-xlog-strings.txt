PV Highlighting Inside KSR.xlog Strings
========================================

KSR.xlog.* methods are the most called KSR functions (140+ unique calls).
Their string arguments often contain PV references like $ru, $ci, $rm
that should be highlighted and support hover/references.

Currently only strings in KSR.pv.* calls get PV analysis. Extending this
to KSR.xlog.* strings would cover a huge portion of real-world code.

Examples from usage:
  KSR.xlog.xinfo("R-URI is current $ru")
  KSR.xlog.xinfo("clearup: clearing DestList=>" + KSR.pv.get("$ci"))
  KSR.xlog.xinfo("route_relay: " + KSR.pv.get("$rm"))
  KSR.xlog.xinfo("R-URI is now $ru")

Implementation:
  - Extend pvExtractor.ts to also walk KSR.xlog.* call nodes
  - Extract PVs from xlog string arguments the same way as KSR.pv strings
  - Mark them as read-only references (xlog never writes PVs)
  - Provide the same highlighting, hover, and references support
